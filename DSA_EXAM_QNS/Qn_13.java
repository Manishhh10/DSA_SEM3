//Genetic algorithms are search heuristics inspired by natural selection. They work by evolving a population of candidate solutions through iterative processes:

// Initialization: Start with a randomly generated population of candidates.
// Evaluation: Use a fitness function to assess each candidate.
// Selection: Choose the best candidates based on fitness.
// Crossover and Mutation: Combine pairs (crossover) and introduce random changes (mutation) to generate new solutions.
// Iteration: Repeat evaluation and selection over many generations, evolving the population toward an optimal or near-optimal solution.

// Advantages:
// Effective for solving complex, nonlinear, and multimodal problems where traditional methods fail.
// Helps avoid local optima by exploring multiple regions of the solution space.
// Can be parallelized, improving efficiency on multi-core or distributed systems.

// Disadvantages:
// Computationally expensive, especially for large search spaces.
// Requires careful tuning of parameters like mutation rate and population size.
// May not always guarantee the best solution and can converge to suboptimal results.

// Example: A classic use case is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the goal is to find the shortest possible route visiting a set of cities. GAs can efficiently search through potential routes and yield a near-optimal solution.
