//Genetic algorithms are search heuristics inspired by natural selection. They work by evolving a population of candidate solutions through iterative processes:

// Initialization: Start with a randomly generated population of candidates.
// Evaluation: Use a fitness function to assess each candidate.
// Selection: Choose the best candidates based on fitness.
// Crossover and Mutation: Combine pairs (crossover) and introduce random changes (mutation) to generate new solutions.
// Iteration: Repeat evaluation and selection over many generations, evolving the population toward an optimal or near-optimal solution.

// Advantages:
// Can solve complex, non-linear, and multimodal problems.
// Robust in avoiding local optima.
// Easily parallelizable.

// Disadvantages:
// Computationally intensive.
// Requires careful parameter tuning (e.g., mutation rate, population size).
// May converge to suboptimal solutions.

// Example: A classic use case is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the goal is to find the shortest possible route visiting a set of cities. GAs can efficiently search through potential routes and yield a near-optimal solution.
